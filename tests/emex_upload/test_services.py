# TODO: Rewrite tests for the new streaming validation service (`validate_file_and_animate_progress`).
# The previous tests for the legacy `process_emex_file` function were removed.
# Those tests covered the following validation scenarios, which should be re-implemented:
#
# 1.  **File Structure:**
#     - A file with the wrong number of columns should be processed, and the malformed rows should be counted as structural errors.
#
# 2.  **Data Integrity:**
#     - Rows with non-numeric text in numeric columns (e.g., "нет цены" in "ЦенаПокупки") should be flagged and counted.
#
# 3.  **Business Logic:**
#     - Rows with invalid values in the 'Склад' column (i.e., not 'ДА' or 'НЕТ') should be flagged.
#     - Rows with invalid INN formats (not 10 or 12 digits) should be flagged.
#     - Rows where `quantity > 0` and `price > 0` but the corresponding `total <= 0` should be flagged.
#     - Rows where `quantity * price` does not equal the total amount (for both purchase and sale) should be flagged.
#
# 4.  **Overall Process:**
#     - A perfectly valid file should be processed with zero errors.
#     - A file with a mix of valid and invalid rows should result in the correct number of good rows being kept and the correct number of bad rows being identified.
