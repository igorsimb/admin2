docs/project_overview.md contains the primary guide for the project
Do not make code changes unless specifically instructed
Never apply superficial "patches" — always identify and address the root cause
For Python-related commands, use: uv run <command>
Use pytest for all unit testing

Type Hinting Guidelines:
- Prefer PEP 604 syntax for union types:
  - Use int | str instead of Union[int, str]
  - Use X | None instead of Optional[X]
- Annotate None explicitly for functions that return nothing
- Always follow PEP 604 style unless backward compatibility with Python <3.10 is required
- Do not mix Optional[X] and X | None in the same codebase
- Avoid excessive type annotations on trivial or obvious code — favor clarity over verbosity

use conventional commits
