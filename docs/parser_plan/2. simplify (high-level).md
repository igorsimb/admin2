# 2. simplify (high-level)



# High-Level Approach to Simplifying the Cross-Dock Functionality

## Overall Strategy

I would approach the simplification with a global perspective first, then local refinements. This ensures that the system is coherent as a whole before optimizing individual components.

***

## Key Principles

### Remove Unnecessary Complexity

* Eliminate the async/await pattern that's being misused
* Replace nested function definitions with clear, separate functions
* Remove the dual storage of task information in both Redis and PostgreSQL

### Establish Clear Boundaries

Create a proper service layer that separates:

* API endpoints (Django views)
* Business logic (services)
* Data access (repositories)
* File generation (utilities)

### Standardize Patterns

* Use consistent error handling throughout
* Standardize logging approaches
* Create uniform parameter passing between functions

### Leverage Django's Strengths

* Use Django models instead of raw SQL
* Utilize Django's form validation for input data
* Take advantage of Django's built-in authentication

***

## Implementation Approach

### Start with Data Models

* Define Django models for task history and other entities
* Create a proper ClickHouse client service

### Build Core Business Logic

* Implement the data processing functions without async
* Focus on making each function do one thing well
* Ensure proper error handling and logging

### Create File Generation Utilities

* Develop clean Excel generation utilities in the common app
* Make them reusable across different parts of the application

### Implement API Layer

* Create Django views that use the business logic
* Add proper validation and authentication

### Set Up Task Management

* Configure Celery tasks with proper task tracking in PostgreSQL
* Ensure clear task status reporting

***

## Specific Improvements

* Replace`_generate_sql_query_percentage()`nested function with a proper service function
* Simplify`process_data()`by breaking it into smaller, focused functions
* Standardize database connections with a proper connection management pattern
* Move configuration from hardcoded classes to Django settings
* Improve error handling with specific exception types and proper recovery

***

## Prioritization

* First focus on the core data flow - from request to ClickHouse query to Excel generation
* Then improve the task management aspects
* Finally refine the API endpoints and authentication

***

This approach ensures that we maintain a holistic view of the system while making targeted improvements that enhance readability, maintainability, and performance. The goal is clean, straightforward code that follows Django best practices and is easy for future developers to understand and extend.
